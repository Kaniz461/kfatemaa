I am a Ph.D. student in Statistics at University of South Carolina advised by Dr. David Hitchcock. During my Ph.D., I have worked as a Graduate Research and Teaching Assistant, gaining experience in statistical consulting, data analysis, and instruction. My research focuses on the spatio-temporal analysis of wildland fire data, examining how biomass consumption and energy release influence fire behavior.\nI am broadly interested in spatio-temporal modeling, Bayesian methods, and machine learning for complex environmental and ecological systems. My work integrates statistical methodology with real-world applications, aiming to develop interpretable and computationally efficient models that support data-driven decision-making in environmental management and sustainability.\n\n© Copyright 2025 Kaniz Fatema.
