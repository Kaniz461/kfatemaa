I am a Ph.D. student in Statistics at University of South Carolina advised by [Dr. David Hitchcock]. During my Ph.D., I have worked as a Graduate Research and Teaching Assistant. In my doctoral research, I focus on the spatio-temporal analysis of wildland fire data, examining how biomass consumption and energy release influence fire behavior. Using thermal measurements collected from prescribed burns in longleaf-pine ecosystems, my work links biomass consumption to fire dynamics through advanced spatio-temporal modeling.\n\n© Copyright 2025 Kaniz Fatema.
